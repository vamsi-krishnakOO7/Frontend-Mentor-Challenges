## Overview

This is the solution for the "Base Apparel Coming Soon Page" Challenge on Frontend Mentor and the aim here is to follow the design provided and to replicate it using HTML, CSS and JS as closely as possible. In this particular challenge, I also had to use the RegEx concept to validate email ID's and if the email ID entered does not meet the requirements of a proper email ID, an invalid Email message must be returned.
